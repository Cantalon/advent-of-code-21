# Advent Of Code 2021 (Java)
Here are my Java solutions for solving the 50 problems at https://adventofcode.com/2021. I feel like the code is pretty self explanatory, but
clarifying comments have been put when I feel is necessary. All programs were written in IntelliJ IDEA CE.

Please don't copy and paste; these were written as solutions, meaning that they should help with the learning process. I myself learned a lot
while writing example code.
